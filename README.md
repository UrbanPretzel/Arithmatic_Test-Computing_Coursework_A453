# Arithmetic Test = Computing-Coursework_A453
---

A Python project completed in 2015 as a basic arithmetic test for 8-10 year olds for my GCSE Computing Coursework (A453). Overall the program is to test the basic arithmetic skills of students in a primary school and give the results for their teacher. 

#### Student Program
The student test consists of 10 randomly generated questions with a variety of mathematic operations (multiplication, addition and subtraction) with random numbers within the question, through the use of random library functions where each question is unique and independent. 
The question is displayed to the user to answer and the score updated. With each question the user is told if their answer was incorrect or correct then another question will be given until ten questions are completed. Once they are finished their score out of ten will be displayed. The score is then saved to a CSV file with their name in a single row. 


#### Teacher Program
For the teacher program, it will iterpret the CSV file and complete the following functions:
1. Show the stored data for a class 
2. Show the data for a class in alphabetical order with their highest result
3. Show the highest test score for each student in a class (Sorted highest to lowest)
4. Show the average score for each student in a class (Sorted highest to lowest)


##### Things I plan to do...
1. Fix bugs
2. Add some of the following things
... The students last three scores will be stored on the same line   
... Sort out any bugs under the issues tab   
... Add an easter egg?
