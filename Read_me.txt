# Aritmatic Test = Computing-Coursework_A453
A Python project completed in 2015 as a basic arithmetic test for 8-10 year olds for my GCSE computing qualification.  

This is a computer program to test the arithmetic skills of students in a primary school for their teacher. 
The test consits of 10 randomly generated questions with a variety of mathematic operations (multiplication, addition and subtraction) and random numbers within the question; with the use of random library functions. As a result each question is unique and independant. 
The question is displayed to the user to answer and the score updated the. With each question the user is told if their answer was incorrect or correct there, and then another question will be presented until ten questions are completed. Once they are finished their score out of ten will be displayed.
